# TypeScript scaffolding for Last Call BBS "servers"

[Last Call BBS](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1511780/Last_Call_BBS/)

The game uses an older version of [jint](https://github.com/sebastienros/jint), and there are a ton of features I found lacking. 
For example, it doesn't support default values for function parameters or arrow functions. It is possible to work around these issues, but it is quite annoying and results in uglier code.
